    Lynn Hershman Leeson writes, “Like computer viruses, they escape extinction through their ability to morph and to survive, exist in perpetual motion, navigating parallel conditions of time and memory. The data is itself a representation of the ubiquitous virtual post human essence, a new curve in our evolving cyborg posture. If human beings are imperfect, their networks are even more so.”(1)</a>

    Russell builds on this writing, “[glitch as] strategy becomes operable in the face of the failure of the systematized networks and the frameworks within which we build our lives.”(92) We no longer desire a sole body, but are made up of many, multiplying daily, evading broken systems, always relating back to our embodied selves.</a>
